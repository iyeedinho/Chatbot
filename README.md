# First-Chatbot-
This is my first chatbot, trying to build my own chatbot using the libraries Rasa-nlu and SpaCy so this is the steps : 

### 1. Create a New Project
The first step is to create a new Rasa project
- [ ] __init__.py : an empty file that helps python find your actions
- [ ] actions.py : code for your custom actions
- [ ] config.yml : configuration of your NLU and Core models
- [ ] credentials.yml : details for connecting to other services
- [ ] data/nlu.md : your NLU training data
- [ ] data/stories.md : your stories
- [ ] domain.yml : your assistantâ€™s domain
- [ ] endpoints.yml : details for connecting to channels like fb messenger
- [ ] models/<timestamp>.tar.gz : your initial model

### 2. View Your NLU Training Data

### 3. Define Your Model Configuration

### 4. Write Your First Stories

### 5. Define a Domain
- [ ] intents  : things you expect users to say
- [ ] actions : things your assistant can do and say
- [ ] templates : template strings for the things your assistant can say
